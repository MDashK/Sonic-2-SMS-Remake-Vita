# Sonic SMS Remake 2 Vita

A port of the fangame **Sonic SMS Remake 2** for the **PSVita**.

Official PC and Android versions on: **sonic-sms-remake.blogspot.com**

**Highlights of the latest update:**

• Fixed major memory leak **(no more crashes! \o/)**
<br>
• 60 FPS mode!
<br>
• Major optimizations overall (now the game runs at a locked 60 FPS even at stock CPU clocks)
<br>
• Lots of other optimizations

**Side notes:**

1. Competition has been removed. Unfortunately, it is not possible to implement it.
2. The game has been optimized to run at a locked 60 FPS even on stock CPU clocks. However, if you feel you are experiencing loss of framerate in any level of the game, it is recommended to overclock your PSVita.
3. So that the Vita can run the game at a consistent 60 FPS with good performance, the following graphical downgrades had to be made:
- Sky High Act 2 had to have the rain animation effect removed. The rain is static.<br>
- Gimmick MT. zones may experience tubes popping-in while you progress in the levels. This is an object optimization that had to be made for performance.
