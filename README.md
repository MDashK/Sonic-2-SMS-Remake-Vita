# Sonic 2 SMS Remake Vita

A port of the fangame **Sonic 2 SMS Remake** for the **PSVita**.

Official PC and Android versions on: **sonic-sms-remake.blogspot.com**

**Expected bugs and issues:**

1. Competition has been removed. Unfortunately, it is not possible to implement it.
2. UnderGround Zone Act2 needs full overclock to 500 Mhz to run at 20~24 FPS. **On PSTV**, expect a little more lag due to the PSTV running at a higher resolution.
3. If you leave the game idleing for too long on the pause screen, it will eventually crash. I honestly have no idea why this happens. It doesn't seem to be related to the game, maybe related to either the GMS Vita executable or a plugin that is generally used by most users. Just be sure to press the PS button before turning off the screen of the console to leave it in standby.
